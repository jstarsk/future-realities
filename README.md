# The Future of Reality -
## VR/AR

# Brief
The Internet today is a network of information. It contains more of 60 trillion web sites, With more of 75 millions of servers, that transmits millions of emails and messages per second. Our lives and work run on this internet of information. But with the quest of artificial realities the internet will become the internet of the experiences. In the next years, the internet of the experiences will be bound and networked together into distributed virtual worlds.

Now those artificial realities are emerging through devices as HTC Vive and Hololens, those are enabling new ways to transmit, quantify, redefine, share or access in new ways of communication and visualized information. To make, say, right now those future realities are becoming a new interface for physical and digital integration on the process of Design (design tools), Manufacturing (industrialization 4.0), Product Deploy (Product engagement,  and updates). By mapping our environments, those devices uses outward-facing cameras and sensors to scan our environment by protocols that save a mapped place in the cloud that allow us to link our profession, tools and spaces. Acting as a IOT devices  that interact with the web and the physical world.

The seminar will introduce you to the current Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality offerings, exploring their fundamental capabilities in software development,  and as well, the  requirements in hardware development. You will be introduced in the basic of coding, and the knowledge necessary to develop Augmented Reality (Hololens) and Virtual Reality (HTC Vive)  application that will interact with internet, microcontrollers, sensors and psychical computers.

Learning Outcomes
Coding: You'll then learn basic coding in C#, and develop more your computer science skills. (No prior programming or Unity knowledge is required)
Devices and Technology: You will learn about the current VR and AR offerings, explore their fundamental capabilities and requirements. 
Physical Computing: You will be able to create your own IOT edge IoT VR or AR application  with Unity and extend it with and raspberry PI or Arduino and their ecosystem.
Installations, Interactions and The Video Game Industry:You will be able to understand how to deploy, target audience  and manage VR or AR proyect. In top of this, you will become a expert user on one of the most used engine to develop games across multiple platforms
